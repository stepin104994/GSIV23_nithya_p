# GSIV23 code Challenge

## Instructions to clone and run the application ##
 Markup : * Clone the code from 'https://github.com/stepin104994/GSIV23_nithya_p.git'
          * Open with any text editor
          * In terminal $cd moviesapp
          * Do 'npm i'
          * Finally 'npm start' should launch the application
          * I have hosted the application here at github pages 'https://stepin104994.github.io/GSIV23_nithya_p/'

## Part of the application that I have made well ##
Markup : * I have structured the codebase neatly
         * Async calls are handled well in saga file
         * The Pagination works like a charm giving a smooth transition
         * The Search feature enabling and disabling works with a ease with very good look and feel 
         * Used all the best advanced features possible to make this code challenge effective
         * Have tried my best to handle errors and no data scenarios
         * Not used any UI frameworks and wanted to exhibit my styling skills

## What could have been improved ##
Markup : * I have not made unit testing for this
         * Considering my tight Schedule in serving notice, I could barely dedicate time for this
         * The application design could have been improvised and made more responsive
