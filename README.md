# GSIV23 code Challenge

## Instructions to clone and run the application ##
* Clone the code from 'https://github.com/stepin104994/GSIV23_nithya_p.git' 
* Open with any text editor 
* In terminal $cd moviesapp 
* Do 'npm i' 
* Finally 'npm start' should launch the application 
* I have hosted the application here at github pages 'https://stepin104994.github.io/GSIV23_nithya_p/' 

## Part of the application that I have made well ##
* I have structured the codebase neatly 
* Async calls are handled well in saga file 
* The Pagination works like a charm giving a smooth transition 
* The Search feature enabling and disabling works with a ease with very good look and feel 
* Used all the best advanced features possible to make this code challenge effective 
* Have tried my best to handle errors and no data scenarios 
* Not used any UI frameworks and wanted to exhibit my styling skills 

## What could have been improved ##
* I have not made unit testing for this 
* Considering my tight Schedule in serving notice, I could barely dedicate time for this 
* The application design could have been improvised and made more responsive 

## Below are the few screenshot of the application
